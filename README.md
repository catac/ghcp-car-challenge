1. Hover over the **Copilot icon** in the Status Bar and select **Use AI Features**
2. Choose a sign-in method and follow the prompts
3. If you don't have a Copilot subscription, you'll be signed up for the [Copilot Free plan](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup) with a monthly limit of inline suggestions and chat interactions

### Step 4 (optional): Install VS Code Extensions

Customize VS Code with extensions from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode):
